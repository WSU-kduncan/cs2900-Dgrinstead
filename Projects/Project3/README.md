# There are a couple of different mounts when you are using docker. The first is bind mounts, and read only bind mounts

## I will start with bind mounts

* Bind Mount: When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file or directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine.


* Read-only bind mount: For some development applications, the container needs to write into the bind mount, so changes are propagated back to the Docker host. At some other times the container needs read access.


1. The first step you want to do is set your command

2. $ docker run -d \

3. -it \

--name devtest \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,target=/app \
nginx:latest 

4. Use docker inspect devtest to verify that the bind mount was created correctly. Look for the Mounts section:

## This is the command

"Mounts": [

    {
	"Type": "bind",
	"Source": "/tmp/source/target",
	"Destination": "/app",
	"Mode": "",
	"RW": true,
	"Propagation": "rprivate"
    }
],

* What this does is it shows that the mount is a bind mount, it shows the  correct source and destination,
it shows that the mount is read-write, and that the propogation is set to rprivate



# Volume Mount

* Volumes are going to be the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker Containers. What
the difference between bind mounts and volumes are volumes are managed by Docker.

## Some advantages are

- Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts
- You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API
- Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add funtionality
